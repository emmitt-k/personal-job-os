Building an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) "score" estimator is a great way to add value to your generator. While every ATS vendor (like Greenhouse, Workday, or Lever) has proprietary algorithms, they generally follow a standard logic based on **parsing accuracy** and **keyword matching**.

Here is a breakdown of how that logic usually works:

---

## 1. The Parsing Phase (Structural Integrity)

Before any scoring happens, the ATS must convert your PDF/Docx into a machine-readable format (JSON or plain text). If the parser fails to read the text correctly, the score will be low regardless of content.

* **Standard Headers:** The system looks for keywords like "Experience," "Education," and "Skills" to categorize data.
* **Chronology Check:** It extracts dates to calculate "Years of Experience." If your date format is non-standard (e.g., "The year of 2022"), the logic might fail.
* **Contact Info Extraction:** It searches for patterns matching emails, phone numbers, and LinkedIn URLs.

## 2. The Semantic & Keyword Match (The "Score")

This is the core of the estimator. Most systems use a variation of **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** or **Cosine Similarity**.

### Weighted Keyword Extraction

The algorithm extracts "Hard Skills" and "Soft Skills" from the Job Description (JD).

* **Frequency:** If "Python" appears 5 times in the JD, it is weighted higher than a skill mentioned once.
* **Position:** Keywords found in the "Requirements" or "Responsibilities" sections of the JD carry more weight than those in the "Bonus" section.

### Vector Representation

The logic often treats the Resume and the JD as two mathematical vectors.

The "Score" is essentially the angle between these two vectors. If the resume contains 80% of the high-weighted keywords found in the JD, the similarity score is high.

## 3. Heuristic Penalties

Many ATS simulators apply "penalties" that lower the estimated score based on formatting:

* **Complex Layouts:** Multi-column layouts often cause text to be read out of order (e.g., reading across columns).
* **Non-standard Fonts:** If the text isn't embedded correctly, it returns gibberish.
* **Graphics/Tables:** Data inside tables or as images is often ignored entirely by older parsers.
